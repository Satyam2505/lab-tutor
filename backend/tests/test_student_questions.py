"""Category 6: the ordinary traffic of a live lab.

Everything ~70 first-year students actually type into a chat box, run
through the real tutor path. Three things are asserted:

1. **Structural invariants hold for every question**, however basic,
   nonsensical or hostile. No crash, no empty reply, no leaked answer.
2. **Triage is precise**, which matters more than recall. A missed
   off-scope question costs nothing; a false positive refuses a real
   chemistry question. The held-out cases below are the ones that caught
   a genuine false positive ("bleed the air out of the burette tip").
3. **Safety handling never depends on a model.** It is asserted with
   inference healthy *and* with inference dead, because the degraded mode
   is documented and expected.
