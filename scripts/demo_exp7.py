"""Runnable Experiment 7 demo conversation.

Drives `backend.retrieval.pipeline.answer_question` through the
conversation scripted in `docs/demo_exp7.md`, printing each turn's
status, routed experiment, answer text and citations exactly as the
pipeline produces them today -- no service, database, or LLM API key
required (`use_llm=False` forces the deterministic extractive path,
which is also what happens automatically whenever no LLM backend is
configured; see `backend/retrieval/pipeline.py::_generate_answer`).

This demonstrates the plumbing honestly: with the IACHY102 manual not
yet in the repository (`docs/current_state_audit.md` §0), the direct
procedural questions correctly resolve to
`IN_SCOPE_RETRIEVAL_INSUFFICIENT` rather than a guessed answer. The
adjacent-theory question resolves to `ADJACENT_SUPPORTED` from the real
`knowledge/adjacent/` corpus, and the out-of-scope turn is refused
before any retrieval runs. Once the manual is ingested, re-running this
script is the fastest way to see which of these flip to
`IN_SCOPE_SUPPORTED`.

Usage:  python scripts/demo_exp7.py
