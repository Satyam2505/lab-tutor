"""Hybrid retrieval with metadata filtering.

Implements three stages of the brief's nine-stage pipeline (§6):
**hybrid retrieval**, **source filtering**, and half of **reranking**
(the rest lives in `rerank.py`, which is a separate, business-rule-driven
pass rather than a scoring detail of the index).

## Why lexical + a local "semantic" layer, not an embeddings API

The corpus is one small, vocabulary-heavy domain document. The
project's existing retrieval module already made this call for the same
corpus and gave the reasoning (`backend/rag/retrieval.py`): no second
provider, no API key, no network hop, no cold-start cost for a machine
serving a lab section.

This module keeps that reasoning but adds the second half of "hybrid":
a **local TF-IDF cosine layer**, computed from the same index with no
external call. It is not a trained embedding model and this docstring
does not pretend otherwise -- it catches synonym-free semantic overlap
that pure term-matching BM25 can miss (shared vocabulary in a different
order, e.g. "output file location" vs "where does the output go"),
without adding a dependency. `backend/llm/client.py` already has a
provider-swappable interface; wiring a real embedding provider behind
`SemanticLayer` is a contained Phase 2 change (see
`docs/handoff_phase2.md` item 4) that does not touch this module's
public surface.

## Source filtering, structurally

`search()` takes `experiment_id` and `usage`. A chunk is a candidate only
if:

* its tier is permitted for `usage` (`sources.tiers.permitted_tiers_for`)
  -- this is what stops a Tier C explainer from answering a direct
  procedural question; and
* its `experiment_id` is `None` (general material) or equal to the
  requested one -- this is what stops Experiment 3 colorimetry chunks
  from outscoring Experiment 7 orbital chunks merely for sharing the
  word "concentration" (brief §6's own example).

Both checks happen before scoring, not after, so a wrong-experiment
chunk cannot win on relevance and then be filtered out too late to
matter for `k`.
