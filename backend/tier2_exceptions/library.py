"""Tier 2: hand-curated library of known non-numeric mistakes.

Consulted only when Tier 1 finds a genuine inconsistency but no numeric
signature explains it. These are procedural errors that leave no
characteristic fingerprint in the numbers -- an unrinsed burette produces
a wrong result that looks arithmetically ordinary.

Scope for this build, deliberately:

* **Static.** Entries are written by hand and reviewed by a human. The
  library does not learn, does not grow from observed cases, and has no
  ML component. TA-driven curation is deferred (ARCHITECTURE.md §2).
* **Small.** Five to ten entries per experiment, maximum. A large
  keyword-matched library starts producing confident wrong attributions,
  which is worse for a student than an honest escalation.

The entries below are *generic wet-lab* mistakes that hold across
titrimetric and colorimetric experiments. Per-experiment entries need the
IACHY102 manual and a demonstrator's judgment about what this cohort
actually gets wrong -- see `EXPERIMENT_SEEDS` and README "Known
limitations".
