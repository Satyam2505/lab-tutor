"""Coverage report: per-experiment question counts, status mix, and which
routing vocabulary has zero question coverage.

The brief asks (section 10) for "Experiment 7 page/section -> number of
golden questions -> pass rate", with the explicit requirement that no
important screenshot/page go uncovered. There are no pages yet -- the
IACHY102 manual is not in this repository (`docs/current_state_audit.md`
§0) -- so a page-level report would be fabricated structure over nothing.

What this script reports instead, honestly, at the level actually
available today:

* **Question count and live status mix per experiment**, from
  `golden_dataset/qa/expNN.json` (each case's `expected_behavior` was
  computed by the live pipeline at generation time, not authored).
* **Vocabulary coverage**: which of an experiment's routing terms
  (`backend/scope/ontology.py`) appear in zero generated questions. A
  term with zero coverage is a term the golden dataset does not actually
  exercise -- the direct analogue of an uncovered page, at the
  granularity this phase has real data for.

Once the manual is ingested and pages/sections exist as real metadata on
`Chunk` objects, this script is the place to add the page-level table
the brief describes -- swap the vocabulary-coverage section for a
page/section groupby over `Chunk.page`/`Chunk.section` for chunks that
were actually cited by an `IN_SCOPE_SUPPORTED` case, and flag any page
tagged as visual (`Chunk.visual_available`) that no case cites.
