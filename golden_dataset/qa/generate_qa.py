"""Generate the Q&A golden dataset: scope-level and routing cases.

Every case here is verified against the *live* pipeline
(`backend.retrieval.pipeline.answer_question`) before being written out,
the same discipline `golden_dataset/generate.py` applies to Tier 1
signature cases: a case whose expected outcome does not actually occur
is a bug in the case, and this script refuses to write the dataset
rather than ship a claim the code does not back up.

## What this dataset can and cannot claim, honestly

This is a **scope-and-routing** regression suite, not an answer-quality
benchmark. It can verify, today, against real running code:

* which `AnswerStatus` a question resolves to (in scope? adjacent?
  out of scope? supported by evidence?);
* which experiment a question routes to;
* that Hinglish/typo variants of a question resolve the same way as
  their clean English equivalent;
* that the four priority experiments' adjacent-knowledge corpus
  (`knowledge/adjacent/`) actually answers the adjacent questions it was
  written for.

It still does **not** verify answer *content* against the manual (that
would require hand-checking each generated answer's prose against the
manual text, which this script does not do) -- only which `AnswerStatus`/
routing/citation-presence outcome a question resolves to, live. Every
case's `expected_answer_facts` is therefore still explicitly `null`, with
a `blocked_reason` on any non-answerable case explaining *why* it wasn't
answered (see `_blocked_reason_for`) -- not an invented fact standing in
for one. The manual (`manual/IACHY102_manual.md`) has been in the
repository since 2026-09-12; the historical "manual not present" caveat
that used to sit here is stale and has been removed.

## Distribution (brief section 8-10)

Target priority weighting: experiment 7 gets the most cases, then 2/3/8,
then the remaining six get baseline coverage each. Scope-level mix per
group aims for roughly the brief's 35/35/15/10/5 split (direct-clean /
direct-messy / adjacent / out-of-scope / adversarial), applied within
each experiment's allocation rather than globally, so every experiment
gets adversarial and out-of-scope coverage rather than concentrating it
in one place.
