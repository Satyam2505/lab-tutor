"""Experiment 02 -- Determination of reaction rate, order and molecularity:
acid-catalysed hydrolysis of ethyl acetate (IACHY102 manual, p.16-19).

STATUS: implemented, with tolerance/fit-quality DEFAULTS the manual does
not state (see below) -- not a manual-verified worked example. Unblocks
Socratic session-start for this experiment; see docs/final_audit.md for
why this differs from Experiment 1's fully manual-grounded checker.

The manual's own formulas (p.18), transcribed exactly:

    k1' = (2.303/t) * log10[(V_inf - V0) / (V_inf - Vt)]
    k1' = slope * 2.303   (from a plot of log10(V_inf - Vt) vs t)

where V0/Vt/V_inf are NaOH titre volumes at t=0, at time t, and at
completion. `RegressionSlopeChecker`'s `y_reference_key` mechanism (added
this session -- see backend/tier1_compute/shared/regression_slope.py)
handles this: the per-point transform needs the student's own V_inf
reading, not a manual constant, at every point.

One interpretive choice, not stated explicitly in the manual: the printed
"k1' = Slope x 2.303" has no minus sign, but the plotted quantity
log10(V_inf - Vt) DECREASES as t increases (Vt approaches V_inf), so its
slope is negative, while a rate constant is conventionally reported
positive. `slope_to_value` below applies `-slope * 2.303`, the standard
kinetics sign convention, not new chemistry -- flagged here rather than
silently baked in.

The manual gives no experiment-specific numeric tolerance or fit-quality
floor (unlike Experiment 1, it has no worked numeric example at all --
see manual/IACHY102_manual.md's summary table). `tolerance`,
`min_r_squared` and `min_points` below are therefore deliberate
engineering defaults for a self-consistency check, not manual-derived
values -- revisit if a worked example or course-stated tolerance ever
surfaces.
